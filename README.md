📌 Project Overview

This project is an extension of my earlier PCOS-Dashboard project.

In the earlier version, the focus was only on:
->entering values
->predicting PCOS
->showing probability

The ML model was already trained there —
and I reused the same model here, instead of retraining it again

🚀 What changed? (From dashboard → real app)

This version is a proper production-style app.
