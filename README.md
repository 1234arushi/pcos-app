## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an extension of my earlier **PCOS-Dashboard** project.

In the earlier version, the focus was only on:

- entering values  
- predicting PCOS  
- showing probability  

The ML model was already trained in that project —  
so I reused the same model here instead of retraining it again.
